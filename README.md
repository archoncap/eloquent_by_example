## Eloquent by Example

"Eloquent by Example" is a series of usage examples of the Laravel Framework's Eloquent ORM, contributed by the community, to make the ORM both easier to learn and teach. We welcome and encourage Pull Requests! A few "ground rules" if you do:

- An important goal is that everyone be able to work with the same code AND DATA. Therefore, we request that you work with the included migrations and seeded data in your examples, or add additional (not replacement) data and tables if required. Schema changes come from migrations, data from Laravel data seeders. 

- To avoid spending (wasting) time with decisions like "which controller should I put this on?", we will collect all controller code in the routes.php file for now. We might change that down the road, so DO please use route aliases to help a later transition.

- We prefer to keep this simple and focused on Eloquent, so unless you have an more complicated case that requires a repository, please don't use those up front. 

- please follow the dirctory structure for views
